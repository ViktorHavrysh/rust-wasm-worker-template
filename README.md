> **Kickstart your Rust, WebAssembly, Webpack and Web Worker project!**

This template is designed for creating monorepo-style Web applications with
Rust-generated WebAssembly running inside a Web Worker and Webpack without
publishing your wasm to NPM.

## 🔋 Batteries Included

This template comes pre-configured with all the boilerplate for compiling Rust
to WebAssembly and hooking into a Webpack build pipeline.

* `npm run start` -- Serve the project locally for development at
  `http://localhost:8080`.

* `npm run build` -- Bundle the project (in production mode).
